# Changelog

All notable changes to `mailtea-mcp` are documented here.

## 0.2.0 (2026-07-21)

### Added

- **Sender tools** — `sender.create / list / update / delete / set_default` for named from-identities on verified sending domains.
- **Suppression tools** — `suppression.add / remove / search` for the org-wide do-not-send list, plus `suppression.export` returning the full list as CSV.
- **`template.render`** — dry-run a template spec to email-safe HTML and plain text without creating a template.
- `template.create` accepts `text`, `from`, and `reply_to` (matching `template.update`).
- `suppression.search` supports `created_after` / `created_before` date filters and `starting_after` cursor pagination.

### Changed

- Domain tool descriptions explain the two-part verification gate: the ownership TXT record **and** the branded DKIM TXT record must both verify before a domain can send. `domain.verify` responses include `dkim_status` and `receiving_mx_found`.
- `webhook.create` lists the full 14-event catalog (delivery, engagement, and contact lifecycle events, including `email.received` for inbound).
- Public tags are described as reader-facing **topics** that act as unsubscribe groups.
